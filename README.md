# google-foobar
Google foobar is an invite only coding challenge from Google with five levels. 

Even though these solutions will pass all the test cases within the time limit, these were not my final submissions.  
I have not added my fully optimized solutions, these solutions should guide you in th ecorrect direction if you get stuck.

Have fun trying to save the bunnies!
